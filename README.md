# Joplin Plugin
This is a Joplin Plugin that replaces resources within Joplin from a local-to-machine location.

# My Problem Statement
I have a large number of resources (images) I desire to downsize and replace within [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/).
I can easily use MacOS Automator to downsize the images for me.
I need a automated way of replacing these images within Joplin.
